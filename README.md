# ParticleGame

#### Author: Jack Fraser

This is a simple particle simulator using cellular automata like in *The Game of Life*.
It is a work in progress, but already shows off a few different particle types that have some
basic rules they follow.

### Current Particles:

* Sand: Falls down and spreads out
* Water: Flows down and to the sides
* Wood: Stationary and flammable
* Fire: Burns up any flammable particles nearby
